/*
 * Problem Statement:
 * - Given a NxN grid, find whether rat in cell [0, 0] can reach the target in cell [N-1, N-1]
 * - The grid is represented as an array of rows. Each row is represented as an array of 0 or 1 values.
 * - A cell with value 0 can not be moved through. Value 1 means the rat can move here.
 * - The rat can not move diagonally.
 *
 * Reference for this problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rat-in-a-maze-backtracking-2/
