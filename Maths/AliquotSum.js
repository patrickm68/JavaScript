/*
  A program to calculate the Aliquot Sum of a number.
  The aliquot sum of a number n, is the sum of all the proper divisors of n apart from n itself
  For example, for the number 6
  The divisors are 1, 2, 3 (we don't consider 6), so its aliquot sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  1 is the only number whose aliquot sum is 0 (since its only divisor is 1 and aliquot sum of a number couldn't have itself)
  For all prime numbers, the aliquot sum is 1, since their only divisor apart from themselves is 1
